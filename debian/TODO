- example port used in Mbt manual is 1999.  However:

/usr/share/nmap/nmap-services :

 tcp-id-port       1999/tcp   # cisco identification port
 tcp-id-port       1999/udp   # cisco identification port

19999 is free according to /usr/share/nmap/nmap-services

- see also Timbl for issues with deluser and old logfiles; and some other stuff too.
