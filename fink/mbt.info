DescPackaging: <<
This package was built on PowerPC running Darwin / Mac OS X v. 10.5,
using fink 0.29.10-41.

FIXME: A libTimbl.dylib symlink should be in "timbl".  libTimbl.2.dylib
should be in a yet to be created package (SplitOff: %N-shlibs).  For now,
we remove the symlink in order to keep fink happy.

TODO: use daemonic (DaemonicFile, DaemonicName) if running daemon is needed.

DescDetail: <<
Memory-Based Learning (MBL) is a machine-learning method applicable to a wide
range of tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The Tilburg Memory Based Learner, TiMBL, is a tool for NLP research, and for
many other domains where classification tasks are learned from examples.  It
is an efficient implementation of k-nearest neighbor classifier.

TiMBL's features are: * Fast, decision-tree-based implementation of k-nearest
neighbor classification; * Implementations of IB1 and IB2, IGTree, TRIBL, and
TRIBL2 algorithms; * Similarity metrics: Overlap, MVDM, Jeffrey Divergence,
Dot product, Cosine; * Feature weighting metrics: information gain, gain
ratio, chi squared, shared variance; * Distance weighting metrics: inverse,
inverse linear, exponential decay; * Extensive verbosity options to inspect
nearest neighbor sets; * Server functionality and extensive API; * Fast
leave-one-out testing and internal cross-validation; and Handles user-defined
example weighting.

TiMBL is a product of the ILK (Induction of Linguistic Knowledge) research
group of the Tilburg University and the CNTS research group of the University
of Antwerp.

If you do scientific research in NLP, timbl will likely be of use to you.
