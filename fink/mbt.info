Package: mbt
# FIXME : better use 3.1.99.1
# http://ilk.uvt.nl/packages/beta/mbt-3.2.0-pre1.tar.gz
Version: 3.2.0-pre1
Revision: 1
BuildDependsOnly: false
Shlibs: %p/lib/libMbt.0.dylib 1.0.0 %n (>= 3.1.4-1)
DescPackaging: <<
This package was built on PowerPC running Darwin / Mac OS X v. 10.5,
using fink 0.29.10-41.

FIXME: Add Timbl (build-)depends

FIXME: A libMbt.dylib symlink should be in "mbt".  libMbt.2.dylib
should be in a yet to be created package (SplitOff: %N-shlibs).  For now,
we remove the symlink in order to keep fink happy.  And for now,
we have to execute "root@dhcp-23.mdcc.cx:/sw/lib# ln -s libTimbl.2.dylib
libTimbl.dylib" before building this package! *Gasp* !

TODO: use daemonic (DaemonicFile, DaemonicName) if running daemon is needed.

DescDetail: <<
MBT is a memory-based tagger-generator and tagger in one. The tagger-generator
part can generate a sequence tagger on the basis of a training set of tagged
sequences; the tagger part can tag new sequences. MBT can, for instance, be
used to generate part-of-speech taggers or chunkers for natural language
processing.

Features: * Tagger generation: tagged text in, tagger out, * Optional feedback
loop: feed previous tag decision back to input of next decision, * Easily
customizable feature representation; can incorporate user-provided features, *
Automatic generation of separate sub-taggers for known words and unknown words,
* Can make use of full algorithmic parameters of TiMBL.

MBT is a product of the ILK (Induction of Linguistic Knowledge) research
group of the Tilburg University and the CNTS research group of the University
of Antwerp.

If you do scientific research in natural language processing, MBT will
likely be of use to you.
